## 📖 Abstract

[IFMIF-DONES](https://ifmif-dones.es/)  is an experimental facility designed to irradiate material samples under conditions similar to those expected in future fusion power reactors. As a radiological facility, its inherent safety risks require the precise design of specific subsystems responsible for the protection of the public, plant personnel and environment. This is the case of the Argon Purification Subsystem (ArPS), which is responsible for ensuring the inertization of those areas with potential presence of liquid Li. However, design decisions regarding purity requirements of such Ar and purification parameters are complex, as many variables must be considered and optimized. To support this design process, a [MELCOR](https://www.sandia.gov/MELCOR/) simulation model of the IFMIF-DONES ArPS has been developed. Using this model, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to study the performance of this subsystem under different configurations. We study how to keep the impurity concentrations of the inert spaces stable during a year of operation to minimize the risk of Li reactions and ensure dynamic confinement, while taking into account external air infiltration. Transitions between maintenance and operation modes are also analyzed, in order to minimize the costs associated with Ar consumption. Finally, we provide a review of potential Li reactions under different scenarios, estimating the associated temperature variations and tritium production in the Ar-served rooms.
